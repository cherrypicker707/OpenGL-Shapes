# OpenGL Shapes
This is just a simple app displaying five random 3D shapes. You can move with W, A, S, D, Q, E, Shift and Space.

It was made with **C**, **OpenGL** (using **glad**) and **SDL2**.

# Requirements
To build and run the app, you need to have C compiler, CMake and SDL2 installed. You also need to generate files for OpenGL 4.6 Core Profile on [glad website](https://glad.dav1d.de/). Put the "glad" folder directly into the main folder.
